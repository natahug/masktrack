This monitor keeps a record of how many people are detected wearing masks in a row. Once the streak reaches 50, Ramses completes the game. MaskTrack and other iterations of this computer vision technology were designed to encourage UNC faculty and students to practice COVID-19 precautions. No video is ever recorded.</p>
            <p id="disclaim">This video feed collects average social distance and the percentages of mask wearers on campus. All data is reported at www.unc.edu/when/dashboard.</p>
